class Runner:
    """Minimal runner that executes an :class:`Agent` via the OpenAI *Responses* API.

    The real project this repository was extracted from relies on the
    ``openai`` package to execute small helper agents.  The original
    implementation is intentionally tiny â€“ the goal is simply to take an
    ``Agent`` instance and a piece of ``input`` and return the model's textual
    output.  The tests for this kata monkeypatch :func:`run_sync`, so the runner
    needs to be small and dependency free at import time while still working
    when used in practice.

    Only the modern Responses API is supported.  Older Chat Completions
    interfaces have been removed to ensure the project targets the Agents SDK
    and Responses API exclusively.  The method always returns an object with a
    ``final_output`` attribute containing the model's response.
