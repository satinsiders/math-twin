Below is a concise, implementable blueprint for a revised structure for the micro solver. present tasks sequentially.

# 0) Core Principles

* **Dual representation**: carry *at least two* interchangeable problem representations (symbolic & numeric; or alternative symbolic frames) and switch when one stalls.
* **Constraint accounting**: track variables vs. independent constraints vs. goals at every step; detect under/over-determination early.
* **Operator market**: expose a small set of reasoning operators (algebraic rewrite, substitution, differentiation, case-split, numeric sample, etc.). A scheduler selects operators based on progress signals, not a fixed “strategy.”
* **Anytime verification**: continuously produce candidate answers (even partial), verify against original constraints, and keep the best valid candidate so far.

# 1) State Model (unified across domains)

```python
State = {
  "R": {            # Representations
    "sym": SymRep,  # e.g., SymPy expressions, equations, inequalities, integrals
    "num": NumRep,  # numeric samplers, discretizations, quadrature settings, grids
    "alt": AltRep   # optional alternative symbolic frame (e.g., substitution vars)
  },
  "C": {            # Constraints (typed)
    "eq": set[Expr==0],
    "ineq": set[Expr⩽0/⩾0],
    "qual": set[meta-constraints],   # monotone, periodic, bounded, parity, domain
    "goals": set[goal predicates],   # target expressions or values
  },
  "V": {            # Variables & domains
    "free": set[Var],
    "bound": dict[Var -> Domain],    # domains for sampling / monotonicity checks
  },
  "A": {            # Answers (candidates)
    "cands": list[Candidate],
    "best": Candidate|None
  },
  "M": {            # Metrics
    "dof": int,          # ≈ |free| - rank(Jacobian of eq)
    "progress_score": float,
    "stalls": int,
    "violations": int,   # number of constraints violated by last candidate
  },
  "log": [...]
}
```

**Invariants (checked every iteration)**

* **Solvability check**: `dof = |free| - rank(∂eq/∂free)` (estimate numerically if needed).
* **Well-posedness**: if `dof > 0` and only one scalar goal remains → **under-determined**.
* **Over-constraint**: if `dof < 0` or infeasible numeric sample → prefer relaxation or branch-split.

# 2) Reasoning Operators (domain-agnostic)

Define a small, composable set. Each operator returns a *delta* to `State` and a *progress signal*.

**Symbolic**

* `O_simplify`: canonicalize expressions; reduce integrands; standardize inequalities.
* `O_substitute`: eliminate variables via solved relations or definitions.
* `O_eliminate`: algebraic elimination (Groebner, resultants), variable projection.
* `O_diff` / `O_integrate`: differentiate/integrate target or constraints (for calc).
* `O_transform`: change of variables (u-sub, linear map, polar, normalization).
* `O_case_split`: split on discrete branches (signs, domains, periodicity classes).
* `O_bound_infer`: derive bounds/monotonicity/convexity from `qual`.

**Numeric / Hybrid**

* `O_feasible_sample`: sample `V.bound`, reject by `ineq`, keep feasible set.
* `O_nsolve`: local root-finding on `eq` with multiple seeded initializations.
* `O_grid_refine`: adaptive grid / interval narrowing using sign tests.
* `O_quad`: numeric quadrature for definite integrals with error control.
* `O_verify`: plug candidate into constraints/goals; compute residuals & error bars.
* `O_rationalize`: fit rationals/algebraics to stable numeric candidates.

# 3) Scheduler (Controller)

A small loop that chooses operators by **progress evidence**, not hard-coded tactics.

```python
def solve(state):
  init_candidates(state)                           # trivial candidates if any
  for it in range(MAX_ITERS):
    update_metrics(state)                          # recompute dof, residuals
    if goal_satisfied(state): return best(state)

    if is_stalled(state):                          # same score for K steps
      state = replan(state)                        # switch rep / branch / op mix

    op = select_operator(state)                    # see policy below
    state = apply(op, state)

  return best(state)                               # anytime return
```

**Operator selection policy (sketch)**

* If `dof > 0` (under-determined) → prefer `O_transform`, `O_substitute`, `O_bound_infer`, `O_case_split`; if still >0 after N tries → `replan()`.
* If `dof == 0` but algebraic system stiff → alternate `O_eliminate` with `O_nsolve`.
* If integrals with complicated forms → try `O_transform` then `O_quad` with `O_rationalize`.
* If inequalities drive the solution (optimization/feasibility) → `O_feasible_sample` → `O_grid_refine` → (optionally) KKT / Lagrange via `O_diff`.

# 4) Re-Planning (when/why/how)

Triggered by:

* `stalls >= S_MAX`, or `progress_score` < ε for T steps, or oscillating candidates.
* Detected under/over determination persists across K ops.

Actions:

* **Representation switch**: `R.sym ↔ R.alt` (e.g., swap variable sets; introduce u-sub; normalize scales; nondimensionalize).
* **Resolution change**: coarsen then refine numeric grid; reseed `O_nsolve` from diverse points.
* **Branch rotation**: enforce different case splits (sign/domain/period window).
* **Goal decomposition**: break compound goals into subtasks with sub-goal verification.

# 5) Constraint Accounting & DOF Management

* Maintain a **rank estimator** using numeric Jacobians at feasible samples (robust to symbolic mess).
* Keep an **independence graph** of constraints: if two constraints are numerically collinear, mark one as redundant.
* Before calling expensive algebra (Groebner), try **rank-repair** via `O_transform` or `O_substitute`.

# 6) Candidate Lifecycle (Anytime)

* `produce`: whenever `O_nsolve`, `O_quad`, or closed-form isolation yields a value, create `Candidate` with metadata: `{value(s), residuals, verified: bool, error_bounds}`.
* `verify`: run `O_verify` against *original* constraints and goals (not the transformed ones only).
* `select`: prefer smallest residual and tightest error bounds; keep a Pareto front if multiple goals.

# 7) Inequalities, Domains, and Qualitative Knowledge

* Represent inequalities explicitly and drive **sampling & pruning** with them.
* Use `qual` constraints as cheap guides: monotonicity → bracket search; periodicity → restrict to one fundamental domain; parity → reduce domains symmetrically; convexity → choose global minimum from endpoints or KKT.

# 8) Termination & Guarantees

* **Success**: goal satisfied within tolerance; return verified candidate with error bars (and rationalized form when stable).
* **Partial**: if budget exhausted, return best verified candidate + certificate: residuals, violated constraints, and the transformations used (reproducibility).
* **Refusal**: if infeasible set proven (e.g., interval arithmetic shows no root), return proof artifact (interval certificates).

# 9) Minimal Interfaces (drop-in)

**Operator API**

```python
class Operator:
  def applicable(self, state) -> bool: ...
  def apply(self, state) -> (state', progress_score_delta)
```

**Scheduler hooks**

```python
def update_metrics(state): ...
def select_operator(state): ...
def replan(state): ...
def goal_satisfied(state): ...
```

# 10) Progress Signals (generic, cheap to compute)

* Δ in `dof` (↓ is good).
* Δ in total residual L2 on `eq` (↓ is good).
* Count of satisfied `ineq` (↑ is good).
* Bound tightening (volume of feasible box ↓).
* For integrals: estimator variance and error bound ↓.
* Symbolic size/complexity (tree size, degree) ↓.

# 11) Examples of Domain-General Behavior

* **Calculus (integral)**: try `O_simplify` → `O_transform` (u-sub/IBP) → if stuck, `O_quad` with error control → `O_rationalize`. DOF check simply looks at whether the target numeric value is determined; inequalities bound the interval of integration or parameters.
* **Equations/Systems**: rank-estimate → if under-determined, `O_transform` or `O_case_split`; if square and stiff, alternate `O_eliminate` ↔ `O_nsolve` with reseeding.
* **Optimization with constraints**: convert to KKT via `O_diff` and handle as system; if nonconvex, use `O_feasible_sample` + `O_grid_refine` + local `O_nsolve`.

# 12) What to Remove from the Old Design

* Single “chosen strategy” that monopolizes representation.
* Blind atomic loops that don’t look at DOF/residuals.
* One-shot Sympy `solve` as the only notion of success.

---

## TL;DR Implementation Checklist

* [ ] Add **DOF & rank** estimator and make it a hard gate before calling solvers.
* [ ] Implement the **Operator** interface + a small pool of symbolic & numeric operators.
* [ ] Replace “choose\_strategy” with a **scheduler** driven by progress signals.
* [ ] Add **replan()** that can: swap representations, reseed numeric solves, and rotate branches.
* [ ] Maintain an **anytime candidate** with verification against original constraints.
* [ ] Log a **certificate** of what was proven (or best residual) on exit.

Build this once, and it will scale across algebra, geometry, trig, integrals, and beyond—because the control logic is about **solvability and progress**, not the domain.
